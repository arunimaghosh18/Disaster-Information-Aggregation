# Real-Time Disaster Information Aggregation Software  
->Real-Time Data Aggregation and Monitoring: The web app collects and displays real-time disaster data from various sources on an interactive dashboard, providing live updates, maps, and alerts to users.  
->AI-Driven Analysis and Alerts: It uses machine learning and NLP to analyze and categorize data, predict disaster impacts, and send customized alerts via multiple channels based on user  preferences.  
->Collaboration and Scalability: The platform supports real-time communication among response teams, integrates with third-party tools, and is scalable on a cloud infrastructure to handle large data volumes during major disasters.  

The aim is to help institutions like NDRF, the state police or even the firefighters to recieve the alerts regarding a disasater as soon as it has occured. By supporting live updates, this project helps them decrease their response time to a distress call significantly.
